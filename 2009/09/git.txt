Git community working howto
===========================

The best thing of distributed systems is that you can experiment with them locally, as if you were
on real life complex distributed systems.

>> Starting the game

    We are going to start the repository. This will allow others to clone from us, and to contribute
    to the project.

        cd ~/project
        git init
        -- regular git workflow
        git commit -a

>> Continuing the game

    Now, imagine we have 3 people that want to contribute to this project. They will clone the main
    repository, that is the repository of the maintainer.

    Since we are cloning, automatically "origin" will point to the maintainer repository.

        mkdir ~/team-members
        mkdir ~/team-members/mariah
        mkdir ~/team-members/john
        mkdir ~/team-members/paul

        cd ~/team-members/mariah
        git clone ~/project

        cd ~/team-members/john
        git clone ~/project

        cd ~/team-members/paul
        git clone ~/project

>> Continuing the game (step 2)

    >> Mariah's changes

        -- regular git workflow
        -- send a mail to the maintainer, that our master has changes and is ready to be merged

    >> John's changes

        -- regular git workflow
        -- send a mail to the maintainer, that our master has changes and is ready to be merged

    >> Paul's changes

        -- regular git workflow
        -- send a mail to the maintainer, that our master has changes and is ready to be merged

>> Merging it all together

    We have received 3 mails from Mariah, John and Paul that they have worked on their respective
    tasks, and they finished them successfully. Therefore, they are ready to be merged. They have
    worked on their master branch, so we can do (and this will work forever from now):

        git remote add mariah ~/team-members/mariah/project
        git remote add john ~/team-members/john/project
        git remote add paul ~/team-members/paul/project

    Now, since they told us there are things we can merge, we fetch from them:

        git fetch mariah
        git fetch john
        git fetch paul

    Now, we can study the changes that they provided:

        git diff master mariah/master
        git diff master john/master
        git diff master paul/master

    And now, if we agree with the changes we can merge all together:

        git merge mariah/master
        git merge john/master
        git merge paul/master

    If the maintainer weren't happy, say with Paul changes, he would email Paul back telling what's
    wrong, and he would do, after receiving the second OK from Paul:

        git fetch paul
        git diff master paul/master
        -- now we are OK with the changes. Paul fixed the problem.
        git merge paul/master

>> Just a bit of centralization

    Despite this system is completely distributed, there is always a point where everybody has to
    agree, and therefore, accept a bit of centralization. What everybody can agree about, is that the
    'official' master branch is on the maintainers' repository. This means that:

        - mariah has still unseen john's and paul's changes
        - john has still unseen mariah's and paul's changes
        - paul has still unseen mariah's and john's changes

    So, there we go:

        cd ~/team-members/mariah/project
        git pull origin master

        cd ~/team-members/john/project
        git pull origin master

        cd ~/team-members/paul/project
        git pull origin master

    Now all them (the maintainer, mariah, john and paul) have the exact same code.

    # send a mail to the maintainer. Our changes are ready

    # the maintainer receives the mails. since probably we will continue our work with this
    # contributors, we add them to the remote list
    cd ~/project
    git remote add mariah ~/team-members/mariah/project
    git remote add john ~/team-members/john/project
    git remote add paul ~/team-members/paul/project

    git fetch mariah
    git fetch john
    git fetch paul

    git merge mariah/master
    git merge john/master
    git merge paul/master

    # Mariah checks if there are changes in the maintainer repository (updates her own copy)
    cd ~/team-members/mariah/project
    git pull origin master

    # John checks if there are changes in the maintainer repository (updates his own copy)
    cd ~/team-members/john/project
    git pull origin master

    # Paul checks if there are changes in the maintainer repository (updates his copy)
    cd ~/team-members/paul/project
    git pull origin master

    # Now everybody has the exact same copy of the code

>> The real world (TM)

In the real world, obviously, Mariah, John and Paul are _not_ going to be borrowing pendrives
to each other for the rest of the team to pull from them. This would be plain crazy, but is
_doable_, which is the important thing.

Is very important to understand that this model could work if we were working on the same
computer where we have rights to read from the others' repository.

However, we tend to create servers and share things there, is more handy.

In this same trend, we must understand that git is distributed in logic terms, not in physic
terms (that in some way, it is too). This means that normally each user has his/her own
repository where he/she can push stuff and people can pull from it. However, all repositories
usually live in the same server. Note this is not a requirement, a team could perfectly work
with some repositories at some server, other repositories at other server and some people
briging their work on pendrives. This is not an issue. Not on distributed systems.

So, where were we ? Ah yes, the real world. So we want to have some kind of "centralization",
actually it is necessary for having some kind of 'order' in the project.

In this case, let's suppose that there is a leader, or a 'release team' that owns a
repository. We can consider this repository the 'official' one for that project. For instance,
if you are going to fetch the Linux kernel sources, you are probably going to fetch them from
Linus' repository.

So in this example, we are going to work as 'sysadmins' at Acme Corp., where we will set up
a repository for each of our 23 employees. Now they have different roles: Mariah is the
project leader, John takes care of some part A of the project, and Paul is the responsible
of a part B of the project. So we have some facts here:

   *) At part A, there are 10 employees working, plus the part A leader, John. 11 employees.

   *) At part B, there are 10 employees, plus the part B maintainer, Paul. 11 employees.

   *) Mariah will only care about John and Paul's repositories. She does not care about the
      rest of the employees repositories. She just has to make sure things get in time and
	  tell John and Paul how their teams are going for the next milestone.

   *) John will be notified by the employees that work with him on part A when there is some
      new thing ready to get in. John will have a look at the changes, an if everything is OK
	  he will 'merge' those changes at some branch of its own. Later on, when he has done
	  more merges from other people of his team and he considers the work is 'done' for this
	  milestone, he can notify Mariah for her to merge everything to the 'official' repository.

   *) Same will do Paul with his team.

Now, let's suppose we have to set up a brand new server at Acme Corp. Let's start:

We need to create 'bare' repositories. This means that these repositories will not have an
'active branch', what makes it perfect for servers.

(DISCLAIMER: we are not going to deal with the typical ssh & friends setup. We are talking
             _only_ about the organization of the server)

For the ease of understanding, we will name only leaders repositories, and the rest will be
kept as numbers.

Let's imagine we have created a user 'git' on this system, and we are working with it. We
also have set up all the needed ssh keys for all the employees.

#!/bin/bash

pushd .
cd

pushd .
mkdir ~/mariah; cd mariah; git --bare init
popd

pushd .
mkdir ~/john; cd john; git --bare init
popd

pushd .
mkdir ~/paul; cd paul; git --bare init
popd

# Part A team

pushd .
mkdir ~/partA ; cd partA
for i in `seq 1 10`;
do
		pushd .
		mkdir "employee$1" ; cd "employee$1"; git --bare init
		popd
		
done
popd

# Part A team

pushd .
mkdir ~/partB ; cd partB
for i in `seq 1 10`;
do
		pushd .
		mkdir "employee$1" ; cd "employee$1"; git --bare init
		popd
		
done
popd

popd

Now with this script, for example, Mariah is going to push all the project, so the rest of
the team can start to work, so she types at her project root folder:

git init
git add *
git commit -a -m "Initial import. Hi git !!"
git remote add origin git@acmecompany.com/mariah
git remote add john git://acmecompany.com/john
git remote add paul git://acmecompany.com/paul
git push origin master

Now, the project is at her repository. She mails all the employees notifying the repository
is ready to be cloned.

Now, there are several ways of doing the rest, but lets pick one of them:

John and Paul type the same thing, each one at their own computer:

git clone git@acmecompany.com/mariah project
cd project
git rm origin
git remote add origin git@acmecompany.com/john    # paul, if it is paul
git remote add mariah git://acmecompany.com/mariah # they both need this. she is the leader,
                                                   # they will have to pull from her
git push origin master

-- OR --

git clone git@acmecompany.com/john project # paul, if it is paul
cd project
git remote add mariah git://acmecompany.com/mariah
git pull mariah master
git push origin master

Now, all part A employees (and part B) do:

git clone git@acmecompany.com/mariah project
cd project
git rm origin
git remote add origin git@acmecompany.com/partA/employeeX  # partB if you are a partB employee, and
       	   			   									   # your employee number at X
git remote add john git://acmecompany.com/john # paul if you are a partB developer. We will
			 								   # pull from him.

-- OR --

git clone git@acmecompany.com/partA/employeeX project
cd project
git remote add john git://acmecompany.com/john
git pull john master
git push origin master

>> Mariah's workflow

John sends her an email. He has merged changes from 5 different repositories, and that completes
something worth being sent itself to the 'official' repository. Everything is at his 'master'
branch, as he said on the email. She trusts him, so she goes for it:

git pull john master
git push origin master

>> John and Paul workflow

An employee notifies he has finished some work. Let's suppose we are on partA of the project, so
we are right now John. John has to review the patch in order to determine if it needs polishing,
or if he can merge it directly. So he does:

git fetch git://acmecompany.com/partA/employee8 master
git diff master FETCH_HEAD

John is OK with the changes, so he proceed:

git merge FETCH_HEAD
git push origin master

Now, after some merges, John will notify Mariah that something is ready by email, and she can
merge it all together on the 'official' repository.

After some time writing long URL's, John decides that he will add remotes for the most active
employees, for example, employee8:

git remote add employee8 git@acmecompany.com/partA/employee8

so the same operations, would have been:

git fetch employee8
git diff master employee8/master
git merge employee8/master
git push origin master

	>> Updating his copy

	   John needs to update his copy everyday. This is because Paul could have finished some work
	   Mariah has merged on the 'official' repo, but he has still unseen. For this operation John
	   will perform:

	   		git pull mariah origin

	   (NOTE: git pull = git fetch + git merge). We are going to do it on one step, since we don't
	   have to review such a merge, and we trust all the changes.

>> An employee

Let's suppose we work on partA of the project, so our boss is John.
